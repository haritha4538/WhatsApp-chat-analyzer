## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the development of “WhatsApp Chat Analyzer”, a Python-based tool created as part of the Hack Culprit Virtual Internship. The goal was to build a functional utility that analyzes exported WhatsApp chat data to extract useful insights such as most active users and frequently used words. The project emphasizes real-world problem-solving, hands-on coding, GitHub collaboration, and practical implementation of theoretical concepts


---

## 2. Problem Statement

With WhatsApp being a primary communication tool, analyzing large chat histories manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Users often need insights like:

Who sends the most messages?

What words are used most frequently?

How is the activity distributed?


This project solves the above by creating an automatic, lightweight analyzer that processes .txt exported chat files and gives clear statistics.

## 3. Project Objectives

- Build a text-based analyzer for WhatsApp .txt chats
- Gain experience with Python scripting and regular expressions
- Learn practical use of GitHub, version control, and open-source tools
- Learn practical use of GitHub, version control, and open-source tools


---

## 4. Development Approach

The project was completed in four key stages:

- **Requirement Analysis & Planning** – Identified the pain point (chat analysis) and defined expected output
- **Development** – Wrote Python script using regex, collections, and file handling 
- **Testing & Debugging** – Used multiple .txt exports to ensure various date formats work Prepared README, sample files, and project report
- **Documentation & Deployment** – Prepared README, sample files, and project report
